  I’m a {{ audience }} learning about {{ topic }} as a {{ learning_stage }} learner.

  I find technical explanations overwhelming, so I’d like an analogy to help me understand it in a simple, relatable way.

  Can you explain {{ topic }} using a real-life scenario that a {{ context }} would be familiar with, such as 
  {{ analogies }}?

  Please cover key concepts such as:
  {% for concept in concepts %}
  - {{ concept }}
  {% endfor %}

  Explanation Requirements:
  {% for item in explanation_requirements %}
  - {{ item }}
  {% endfor %}

  Formatting Guidelines:
  {% for format in formatting %}
  - {{ format }}
  {% endfor %}

  Constraints:
  {% for constraint in constraints %}
  - {{ constraint }}
  {% endfor %}

  Output Format:
  {% for output in output_format %}
  - {{ output }}
  {% endfor %}

  The analogy should make it clear why {{ topic }} is useful and how it helps with {{ purpose }}. 
  Please ensure the explanation is **{{ tone }}**.
